A true de-jure digital justice system

It has been said that power corrupts and absolute power curropts absolutely.
We have a system of justice that has been corrupted.  More and more citizens are starting to asks questions.  Like "how can I be held in comtempt of court for mentioning the Consitution?"  The answer is becuase you signed up for a franchise/contract with the federal government and your legal domicile is now in the District of Criminals where the constitution and the bill of rights have no effect!  The courts are using your very own legal ignorance against you for their benifit!
We are building a digital justice system such that when facts are entered into the network that after consensus with the network and have been determined to be true will be rewarded with a cryptocurrency.  Those facts that turn out to be false and malicious will incur a cost.  If justice isn't enough to warrent integrity, perhaps a financial incentive will be.

# The Network
The network will consist of 11 different blockchains called pods.  These must be seperate becuase of the data content and size.  Each pod will have to have its own set of nodes for consensus.  Miners will verify that the chain is valid and will periodically be rewarded with a cryptocurrency with enough to reward the individuals who submitted true facts as well.  This gives incentive to users who wish to add data to the network.  It will also encourage the user to submit true facts becuase they will incur a cost if their data(facts) turns out to be false as the network will determine with another consensus among the 11 different pods.

# Consensus
This network will have two different consensus algorithms, one to verify that the pods have true and valid facts and the other to cross reference the other pods to verify facts from other pods.  For example, a rule of statutory construction says that the implementing regulations in the CFR can NOT be greater or more expanded than the code written in the USC.  If they are the US Supreme court has held that the implementing regulation is void or null becuase it violates the rules of statutory construction.  Another example would be the fact that if there are no implementing regulations found in the CFR, then that code that is defined only in the USC must be rules for only public officers and NOT the general public at large.  This is so becuase CFR acts as public notice to all citizens of the Nation and if there is no public notice, then that rule can only be applied to those individuals who hold a public office within government as it does not apply to the greater population at large.  
Eventually the network will be aware of all relevant facts of law to the current date, at which point it will be ready to be used as the authority of justice in a court of law.  When a corrupt judge/adminster attempts to make a ruling or an adjudication that is inconsistent with already accepted true facts according to all the rules of our legal system, he/she will have to pay the network or make a different ruling, one that fits with accepted law.

# Pods
The network will have to have at least 11 different blockchains that I am calling pods.  This must be so becuase the data content and size would be much to large for users to download in order to participate in the network.  These 11 pods will be
1. Constitution
2. Statutes at Large
3. Rules of statutory construction & Maximums of Law
4. Blacks Law Dictionary
5. Uniform Comercial Code
6. United States Code
7. Code of Federal Regulations
8. Circut court rulings
9. District court rulings
10. Supreme court rulings
11. Smart Contracts

All facts within a pod will be tied together in a hashed record of blocks.  This will become the "record" of the new digital legal system.  For any judge/adminstrator to add a new case of facts into the digital record, he/she will be forced to either pay a fee for false facts to be entered or make an adjudication that matches with accepted and known truths of law.

# Cryptocurrency
The network will have to design a cryptocurrency in order to give incentive for true facts of data.  This must be so becuase as the system is today, integrity alone is not enough for corrupt judges/adminstrators to uphold the law.  Either true facts of data are entered into the network for a reward of cryptocurrency or a fee of cryptocurrency will be incurred for false facts of data.  The network will have to have a loading phase before the network can be used as a digital record.  All true facts of data must be loaded into the digital record before it can go live for real use.  Once we have a digital record in the blockchain of all true facts up to the current date, the network will be ready to be used as the new digital record of law.  I am anticipating a pushback from government becuase this system will no doubt expose their fraud on a wide scale basis.  However, if there is enough demand from the community for true de-jure justice, there will have to come a time when it will be implemented first as a use-case, and then moved into more court rooms as the demand and acceptance of the population grows.
The cryptocurrency will have a finite limit similar to that of Bitcoin as to make it a sound monitary value system.  Initially crypto-coins will be distributed to the miners of the network for submitting true facts of data and the users who submitted those true facts.  The distribution of cryptocurrency will be half of the initial limit followed by another halving when the netowrk is fully loaded with true facts of law and legal cases.  After this second halving, the supply will gradually be reduce in half every so often.  To be later determined at this point, perhaps every 10 years or so.

# Smart Contracts
This network will have to be implemented with its own Turning-Complete langauge similar to that of the Etherium network.  If we are building a new digital record of law, then it only makes sense to build smart contracts right into it for obvious reasons. These contracts will be deployed on their own blockchain within another pod of the network.   These contracts can be crossed referenced with the other pods of law and legal cases to check the validity before they are deployed.
